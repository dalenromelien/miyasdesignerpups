                Hello and welcome to our little slice of paradise. Miya's Designer Pups was born during the summer of 2020 when my mother and I purchased our first akc certified furbaby from a family friend who breeds Standard Poodles. Our male Standard Poodle Titan is all black with a gentle giant disposition, he hates getting his feet wet but loves a good rub down. We decided we would like to try our hand at being breeders as well and help provide family loving pups to equally loving families. The Breeder we got our first pup taught us the basics and put us in contact with other resources so we would have a solid foundation. We researched day and night and redesigned our backyard to accommodate for our new adventure. As a family that loves animals, dogs especially, we were very excited to get started.

                Soon after or male poodle we got our female standard poodle, a petite black which neither of her parents are. We continued to hash out our ideas and continued to research. We discovered that there was a plethora of Poodle breeders in Michigan because of this we decided we would also do GoldenDoodles and Golden Retriever puppies. We got our next two pups, Certified Akc Golden retrievers from outside the state of Michigan. We got Mazikeen, or Maze, first she was the feistiest out of all her siblings and we fell in love, she was very cuddly as a pup and has kept that same cuddly personality.

                The final member of our family is Thor our male Golden retriever he is a very handsome boy and another gentle giant. He's a bit slobbery and doesn't know his own strength and can be a bit of a cartoon character too. We love an cherish all of our adorable pups and we cherish the mini miracles they give us too. We pride ourselves on breeding happy, healthy, and family friendly pups! Welcome to the family!
